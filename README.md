# DS-A-Predicting-Billionaires-Net-Worth-Based-on-Age
Project Title: Predicting Billionaires' Net Worth Based on Age

Project Overview
In this data-driven project, we aimed to analyze the relationship between the age of billionaires and their net worth using the Billionaires Statistics dataset. We developed a machine learning model to predict a billionaire's net worth based on their age. This project not only provided valuable insights into wealth distribution but also demonstrated the application of regression analysis in real-world datasets.

Dataset
Source: Billionaires Statistics dataset
Features: We selected the 'age' column as the feature for prediction.
Target Variable: The target variable was 'finalWorth,' representing the net worth of billionaires in billions of USD.
Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
We performed data preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
We split the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
2. Model Selection
We chose a Linear Regression model for this project as it is a suitable choice for predicting numeric values like net worth.
3. Model Training
We trained the Linear Regression model on the training dataset, using the 'age' feature to predict the 'finalWorth' target variable.
4. Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance using two key metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): To measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual net worth values.
R-squared (R2): To assess how well the model explains the variance in net worth based on age.
5. Visualization
We created a scatter plot to visualize the actual data points and the regression line generated by the model.
The visualization helped us understand how well the model fits the data and the trend between age and net worth.
Results and Insights
The Linear Regression model achieved a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a high R-squared (R2) value, indicating that age is a significant factor in predicting billionaires' net worth.
The scatter plot showed a positive linear relationship between age and net worth, suggesting that, on average, older billionaires tend to have higher net worth.
Conclusion
This project demonstrated the utility of machine learning and regression analysis in predicting and understanding the relationship between age and net worth among billionaires. It provided valuable insights into wealth distribution and factors influencing billionaires' financial success. The project's success underscores the importance of data-driven analysis in gaining deeper insights into complex societal and economic phenomena.
